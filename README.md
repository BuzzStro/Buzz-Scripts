# Buzz-Scripts
My goal is to make useful scripts on Arch Linux For example: Ascii art Maker (We add these as desired, you can upload and add them) My second goal right now is to have files, applications and everything in one menu, even all terminal commands in a graphical way These are my current goals, thank you.
