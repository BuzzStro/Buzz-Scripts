# Buzz-Scripts
My goal is to make useful scripts on Arch Linux For example: Ascii art Maker (We add these as desired, you can upload and add them) My second goal right now is to have files, applications and everything in one menu, even all terminal commands in a graphical way These are my current goals, thank you.


source= part waits for which files are used if you have trust issues you can look at it as you wish

you can think of the install part as sending files to /usr/bin
sending to bin allows the chmod command for the file to work everywhere

chmod u+x part allows the files sent to bin to work as commands
